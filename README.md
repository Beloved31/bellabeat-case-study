# Bellabeat Case Study (Data Analytics Capstone)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone**.  
The case study explores how **Bellabeat**, a wellness technology company for women, can leverage smart device usage data to improve its **marketing strategy**.  

Using the **Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset** (Kaggle, CC0 Public Domain), I performed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualisation in **R** to uncover trends in activity, sleep, and lifestyle habits.  
The final deliverables include a **report, presentation slides, cleaned dataset, and Kaggle notebook**.
